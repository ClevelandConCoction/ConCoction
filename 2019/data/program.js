You and your friends survived the plane crash, but will you survive the night? Work together to forage for food, craft a fire, and build shelters, but be wary: every step you take in the ravine could be one step closer to madness. During the Day, players risk their hearts to leave camp and forage for food and supplies. Before sunset, players work together, share what they found, and craft supplies. If you prepare well enough, you may survive the Night. Be prepared for more than just bumps in the night. Weather, animals, and other wild things will put you and your team to the test. BEWARE: Fall below two hearts and you will go mad. Lose all of your hearts to risk or the elements, and you lose the game. Survive all of the Night cards in your deck, and you win.","loc":["Annex: Hayes & Pre-Function"],"tags":["gaming","card"],"people":[{"name":"Austin","id":"81"}]},{"id":"244","title":"Infinite Galaxies","date":"2019-03-02","time":"09:00","mins":"240","desc":"Blast Off For Adventure With Infinite Galaxies!
